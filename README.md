# Who am I?
My name's Abdulqadir, you may call me Abdo. <br>I'm a BCIT CST student, coding my way through my software journey.<br>
Learning new things every day and I'm always on the lookout for more opportunities to grow my skill-set and experience.

### Current Role:
CTO @ Enactus BCIT and Lead Developer on Ecometer.

### Previous Role:
System Analyst Co-op for the Provincial Health Services Authority of British Columbia.

### What's new?
* My LAST term at BCIT as a CST student, working with a local Vancouver company to develop a mobile app, built in TypeScript and React Native. Fun stuff!
* Ecometer is teaching me Ruby on Rails and working with a prexisting code base that was in e rough shape, my team and I are currently tending to its many issues while preparing the grounds for new features coming soon.
* Just completed a personal project called '**_AudioReaper_**'. It's not perfect but it's almost complete (awaiting Spotify review for API quota extension).
* My co-op at Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) has reached it's end, I've learned a great deal and gained lots of experience with PowerShell, SQL,Active Directory, and some C# and JS.
