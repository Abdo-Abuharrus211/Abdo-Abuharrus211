# Ya hala!
I'm Abdo. I like code things up, watch them break, scratch my head, and try to fix them.

### Current Role:
CTO @ Enactus BCIT and Lead Developer on the Ecometer project; a Ruby on Rails app that helps restaurant goers make informed choices regarding restaurants sustainability.

### Previous Role(s):
- System Analyst Co-op for the Provincial Health Services Authority of British Columbia (PHSA).

### What's new?
* My LAST term at BCIT as a CST student, the journey nears its end...
* Currently working with a local Vancouver company to develop a mobile app, built in React Native and using TypeScript. Fun stuff!
* Ecometer is teaching me Ruby on Rails and working with a prexisting code base that was in e rough shape, my team and I are currently tending to its many issues while preparing the grounds for new features coming soon.
* Just completed a personal project called '**_AudioReaper_**'. It's not perfect but it's almost complete (awaiting Spotify review for API quota extension).
* Looking forward to staring new projects, some grander than others but as long as I'm busy learning, I'm happy.
