# Ya hala!
I'm Abdu. I like to code things up, watch them break, scratch my head wondering why, and try to fix them.

## Roles
### Current Role:
CTO @ Enactus BCIT and Lead Developer on the Ecometer project; a Ruby on Rails app that helps restaurant goers make informed choices regarding restaurants sustainability.

### Previous Role(s):
- System Analyst Co-op for the Provincial Health Services Authority of British Columbia (PHSA).

## What's new?
* My last term at BCIT as a CST student, the journey nears its end... I'm looking forward to joining the industry and having time for some new and exciting projects!
* Currently working with a local Vancouver company to develop a React Native mobile app, fun stuff!
* Updating and fixing a Ruby on Rails app that was in rough shape, my team and I are currently tending to its many issues while preparing the grounds for new features coming soon.
